          "question": "Do I need a referral from a doctor?",
          "answer": "No, you don't need a doctor's referral to book an appointment with our physiotherapists. However, some insurance providers may require a referral for coverage, so we recommend checking with your insurance company first."

          "question": "Do you accept insurance?",

          "question": "What should I wear to my appointment?",
          "answer": "Please wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that allows easy access to the area requiring treatment. For lower body issues, shorts are recommended, and for upper body concerns, a tank top or t-shirt is appropriate."
