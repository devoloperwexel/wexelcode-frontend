        },
        "q2": {
          "question": "What technical and organizational measures are in place for the WexelCode premises?",
          "answer": "It would be ideal if the meeting could take place in a quiet room with a stable internet connection and enough space for movement during the therapy session. Additionally, you will need a computer with video and microphone functionality."
        },
        "q3": {
          "question": "What costs are associated with using WexelCode?",
          "answer": "There are no costs for existing patients. As a new customer, you only need to pay â‚¬20 per therapy session."

          "answer": "Data protection is our top priority. WexelCode complies with all data protection regulations and uses end-to-end encryption for the video consultations."
        },
        "q6": {
          "question": "How are therapy plans personalized with WexelCode?",
          "answer": "The therapy plan is created at the beginning of treatment in close collaboration between the patient and the physiotherapist. The goal is to develop a personalized training plan for home use by the end of the therapy session."
        },
        "q7": {
          "question": "Is it possible to use WexelCode without prior knowledge of physiotherapy?",
          "answer": " Yes, no prior knowledge is required. Any questions can be thoroughly addressed during the first therapy session."
